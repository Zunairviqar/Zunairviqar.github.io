Communication Lab First Assignment
PROMPT
Create a web page to house and debut your 30MFF. Think about how you want to "brand" the film. What is the story? The title? The tag line? The font? The colors? Reviews? Bios for the actors? Behind the scenes photos? Your final site with embedded video should be uploaded and live on your GitHub pages. It should include a .html file, a .css file, and a .js file. You should incorporate at least one element of "interactivity" on the page.

Examples of interactivity include but are not limited to the following:
a "photo carousel" where images change upon clicking
a DOM change based on mouse position/scroll
a slider to control the look of the page
