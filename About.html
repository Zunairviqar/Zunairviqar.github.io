          This is a project by a group of students enrolled in Communications Lab (Summer). As part of the assignment, we were required to produce a video in thirty minutes and individually make a website by implementing the skills we have learned in this class. Our aim was to make a video to encourage people towards the ways they can spend their quarantine during COVID productive.

            The very first activity of this course is called the 'Thirty Minute Film Festival' , that required us to make a video in thirty minutes using our creativity spontaneously by working in a team remotely from four different areas of the world and coming together with content that depicted a story.        </p>
